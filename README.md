# WeTransfer circuit-breaker

The solution is building a simple circuit-breaker using Python.

The idea is that when you make a remote call(HTTP Request/RPC) to another service, there are chances that the remote call might fail.

The service stats:

    Closed: The closed state is the default "everything is working as expected" state. Requests pass freely through.
    Open: The open state rejects all requests without attempting to send them.
    Half-Open: A set number of requests are let through in order to test the status of the resource. This state determines if the circuit returns to closed or open.


## Description

circuit-breaker purpose:

* To prevent a network or service failure from cascading to other services.
* Saves bandwidth by not making requests over a network when the service youâ€™re requesting is down.
* Gives time for the failing service to recover.
