# Circuit-breaker

The solution is building a simple circuit-breaker using Python.

The idea is that when you make a remote call(HTTP Request/RPC) to another service, there are chances that the remote call might fail.


## Description

A service is best described in three states:

* Closed: The closed state is the default "everything is working as expected" state. Requests pass freely through.
* Open: The open state rejects all requests without attempting to send them.
* Half-Open: A set number of requests are let through in order to test the status of the resource. This state       determines if the circuit returns to closed or open.

### Purpose

* To prevent a network or service failure from cascading to other services.
* Saves bandwidth by not making requests over a network when the service you’re requesting is down.
* Gives time for the failing service to recover.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Install Flask and requests. Ipython is optional

```
pip install requests
pip install Flask
pip install ipython
```

### Installing

* Run the development server
```
export FLASK_APP=main.py

flask run
```


### Executing program

* Use the snippet.py to run and test it out.
* Open up a terminal and run the following commands using ipyhton
```

WeTransfer git:(main) ✗ ipython

In [1]: from circuit_breaker import CircuitBreaker
In [2]: from snippets import make_request, faulty_endpoint, success_endpoint
```
